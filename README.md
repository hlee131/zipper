# Zipper

This is a ZIP compressor implemented from scratch for an independent study project back in my junior year of high school. All the code in this repository is written without any non-standard libraries and everything from the bitstream data structure to the DEFLATE file format was implemented by hand. This repository was originally part of a larger collection of independent study projects from high school available [here](https://github.com/hlee131/apt-projects).
